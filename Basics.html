			       <p>Did you know that your brain is taking in over 1 million pieces of information a second? This is quite fascinating, but there is no way you are aware of all that information. That is where the RAS(Reticular Activating System) comes in. This little gadget of your brain filters all of that information down to a slick 1000 pieces of information every second. Now, why does this have anything to do with being engaged? Well, because this is the filter of everything you see, touch, taste, smell and hear, this can contribute highly to the pieces of information you hear. If you are not focused during a class for example, just peacefully daydreaming in your little world, surfing through your thoughts, then that is what you are processing and filtering, if you are focused, your brain will take in more and more information from what you are learning. If you are curious, then you will be engaged and if you are engaged, then your RAS will process more of what you want it to.</p>

			     <p>The ollie is one of the most fundamental tricks in the whole realm of skateboarding. When people look at ollies for the first time, they tend to get confused as to how the skateboarder gets off the ground. There are also different types of ollies such as fakie ollies and nollies. A fakie ollie is where you ride fakie/switch(putting your back foot in the front vice versa) and ollie on your nose. This way, the same foot as in a regular ollie slides up the grip tape. Another variation is a nollie which is almost like a fakie ollie but you ride regular. This is much harder because your feet that are used to sliding up the grip tape or popping the board are doing the opposite thing. </p>

			      <p >In this video, the skater performs an ollie. First, the skater pushes down on the tail of his board. In newtons second law, he said that if a force is applied to another object, that other object will apply a force back. This can be shown as pop. Although the board is moving up, as it was pushed down, it rotated around a point on the wheel so as the board moves up it is highly slanted. This is why the skateboarder slides his foot up the Grip tape to bring it up and push it out. The reason the board  goes up is because the friction that the grip tape creates help slides the board up. Then once the skater has got as high as he can, the gravity will pull him down.</p>

			      <p>Gravity is one of the most mysterious, non-understable forces of our very own universe but to make it simple, it is a curvuture in space-time. The first thing you must now is that weight is not mass. The difference between weight and mass is that mass is measured in kilograms and weight is measured in newtons. The earths gravitational field strength is roughly 10 newtons so a 10kg block would have a weight of 100 newtons. This is because on the moon or other places in the universe, the gravitational field strength is different. If there were a 4 kilogram mass on the moon, its weight would be 6.4 newtons. Try and guess what the moons gravitational field strength is.</p>
