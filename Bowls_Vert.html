			       <h3>Why be <b>Engaged</b>?</h3>
			 
			       <p>Did you know that your brain is taking in over 1 million pieces of information a second? This is quite fascinating, but there is no way you are aware of all that information. That is where the RAS(Reticular Activating System) comes in. This little gadget of your brain filters all of that information down to a slick 1000 pieces of information every second. Now, why does this have anything to do with being engaged? Well, because this is the filter of everything you see, touch, taste, smell and hear, this can contribute highly to the pieces of information you hear. If you are not focused during a class for example, just peacefully daydreaming in your little world, surfing through your thoughts, then that is what you are processing and filtering, if you are focused, your brain will take in more and more information from what you are learning. If you are curious, then you will be engaged and if you are engaged, then your RAS will process more of what you want it to.</p>

			<h2>BVM</h2>
			
			<img src="images/Skatepark-2.jpg" alt="MegaRamp" id="floatRight">
			
			<p>Just to clear things up, BVM stands for Bowl, Vert, MegaRamp. A bowl is quite self-explanatory, Vert is basically half pipe but it is not sloped and MegaRamp is half gigantic 75 foot jump and half Vert. There are two very important aspects of these three genres and they are dropping in and pumping. To give you the main idea, dropping in allows you to enter whatever genre of the three you are skating with a lot of speed and pumping helps you increase your speed while riding on the features. Both of these can be related through the science topic of centripetal force and your center of mass.</p>

		       	  <p> In this video, a famous skateboarder named Aaron Kyro teaches you how to pump. This is a good way to show you how skateboarders do it and how efective it is. As you can see, just by starting out with a little bit of speed, he was able to build onto it and reach the top of the ramp. Because he is crouched down at the top of the arc(ramp), by raising his center of mass near the bottom, he manages to speed the board up. For Vert and MegaRamp skaters especially, this maneuveur can be really useful inhelping the skater get higher off the ground.</p>

			<p>Instead of thinking what to do when we face the problem of speed, lets look to what causes the problem. This force that causes this problem is called centripetal force. Centripetal force is when say for example you have a pendulum, and you make the pendulum swing in a circle, the centripetal force is the force that is pulling the end of the pendulum back in to stop it from swinging out. It is more complicated on the skateboard front but in this case, the centripetal force is trying to pull the skateboarder down from the ramp's arc. The equation for centripetal force is F(Centripetal Force)=M(Mass of Object)xV(Objects Velocity)to the power of 2 divided by R(Radius of Circle Curve). </p>
