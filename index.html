			       <p>Did you know that your brain is taking in over 1 million pieces of information a second? This is quite fascinating, but there is no way you are aware of all that information. That is where the RAS(Reticular Activating System) comes in. This little gadget of your brain filters all of that information down to a slick 1000 pieces of information every second. Now, why does this have anything to do with being engaged? Well, because this is the filter of everything you see, touch, taste, smell and hear, this can contribute highly to the pieces of information you hear. If you are not focused during a class for example, just peacefully daydreaming in your little world, surfing through your thoughts, then that is what you are processing and filtering, if you are focused, your brain will take in more and more information from what you are learning. If you are curious, then you will be engaged and if you are engaged, then your RAS will process more of what you want it to.</p>

				    <p>Welcome to the Physics of skatebaording. Here you can learn about the basics of physics and skateboarding in one package. This website was designed to teach physics in an engaging way.  To start on the skateboarding front, Skateboarding has 5 genres, these are: Street, Park, MegaRamp, Vert and Freestyle. Street and park are almost like brothers, all skills you take from park can be directly translated and used in street. This relation ship can also be found between MegaRamp and Vert but freestyle is on its own. To tie up all these genres, they all revolve around thing, a skateboard and the ollie.  </p>

			        <td>Here is a video that is about a group of skateboarders who took a trip to one of china's ghost cities. In this video you can see a series of tricks performed such as fliptricks, pop shove-it's, ollies and manuals. As you may have guessed, the genre of skateboarding in this video is a very creative street skating video. Try and look closely to these skateboarders and their tricks while watching this video. How do you think they<b> get off the ground? </b> </td>

			     <p>To talk more on the science front, studying physics through skateboarding will allow you to cover the topics of gravity, centripetal force, momentum and friction. Firstly, one of the most important parts of a skateboard is the grip tape. The reason this peice of material is so important is because it creates lift( a force) through friction created by the skateboarder sliding their foot up the grip tape. Secondly, pop is one of, if not, the most useful fundamental of skateboarding that the skateboarder creates. Pop is most common in ollies or tricks involving ollies because it helps the skateboarder get off the ground. Thirdly, when spinning, skateboarders can tweak the laws of conservation of angular momentum in order to help them rotate on their own.</p>
